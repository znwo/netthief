Who stole the bandwidth? Internet usage/monitoring for home and small business connections

Provide a nice front end to a collection service for network traffic and data for small local networks.

I am going to try and map it out and plan it as much as possible, so that if anyone wants to help and contribute or whatever
they will see where the plans are going and be able to fill in easily and without much work / effort.

Testing will be done on interfaces that are specified but otherwise only as interest shows...

Languages used will be preference to users, hopefully can make it so anything can slap in or fit over the top to make it work...



Main interfaces will be:
  Data Collection Service and Delivery (used for getting Network traffic information into the system)
  Real Time data monitoring, for on demand views of users / clients
  Web Front End data extrapolation and manipulation (through a restful interface? maybe all restful interfaces?)
  Web Front End plugins' to allow extensions easily built into a nice UI.
  
  themes etc for web front end, work out with web front end, its always nice to make things themeable and skinnable and what not
