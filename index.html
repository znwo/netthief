        <p>Keeping track of internet usage and bandwidth usage in a household is becoming harder and harder.  While this isn't a full solution, if you are in a position to capture the traffic being used on your network from internal IP addresses.  I plan to deliver a nice visual solution to viewing, monitoring and even working with the traffic flows in your network.</p>

<p>Features I am interested in providing:
  Mapping IP's / MAC Addresses to users
  Usage Patterns identifying
  Port information useful displays
  Destination tracking as appropriate, maybe global domains, depending on long term archival.  Short term archival may store more pertinant information.
  Hooks into firewalling / caching information as needed (through plugins?)
  Plugin architecture with full control and access to the flows being delivered, as well as visual tools that are being used.
  Alerts when data usage is high or is high for periods (hour / day / month)
  Real Time monitoring and Usage tracking
  Real Time flows down to detailed levels if provided.
  Want to have a nice open interface that can hook onto any data providers to store and provide data in and out.  Will need to be both ways for providing real time hooks.</p>

<p>Pretty Pictures and easily identifiable information for the average users, as well as more detailed and drilled in information for more advanced users.</p>

<p>Ability to install yourself or have information be hosted for others to view and see..  they deliver it to you in whatever format used (realtime may not be available in these circumstances)</p>

<p>more ideas and information to come.</p>
